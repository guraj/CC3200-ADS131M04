# CC3200 & ADS131M04 SPI Communication

## Overview
This repository contains C files that set up SPI communication between the CC3200 MCU and the ADS131M04 ADC. The firmware is ported from MSP432 and transmits ADC information via WebSockets using the CC3200's SimpleLink Wi-Fi.

## Features
- SPI communication setup
- ADC data readout
- WebSocket data transmission
- MSP432 code porting

## Requirements
- CCS v6 (Code Composer Studio)
- CC3200 SDK
- SimpleLink Wi-Fi SDK
- CC3200-LAUNCHXL (SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3200 LaunchPad)

## Acknowledgments
This project was completed as part of Dr. Wentai Liu's Biomimetic Research Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles and under the supervision of Yan Peng Chen. Texas Instruments' SBAC254 support package for the ADS131M04.
